# IEEE-MATLAB-Tutorial

Tutorials for IEEE MATLAB workshop, suitable for various interests and levels of experience.

## Description

Tutorials are sorted by "Beginner" and "Intermediate," and are located in the folders of the same name. 

### Beginner Tutorials
In Beginner Tutorials, Essentials.mlx focuses on core concepts needed for programming in MATLAB, i.e., matrix operations, logic operations, and conditional statements and loops. Start with this tutorial if you have little-to-no experience with MATLAB. Plotting.mlx goes through some of the basics of line plots. This tutorial requires some foundational knowledge of MATLAB, so if you need a refresher, you may want to go through Essentials.mlx first or use it for reference.

### Intermediate Tutorials
In Intermediate Tutorials, there are two application-based tutorials, contained in the folders "Lab 4 — Diodes and Transistors" and "HW 7 — Load Lines." In "Lab 4 — Diodes and Transistors," you'll find a script called lab4_tutorial.m. To complete the tutorial, open the script, go through the code, and find the areas in which you have to fill in the code. These will be marked by the commented text "YOUR CODE HERE" and will have instructions on how to fill them in. As you're going through the exercise, try to understand what the code is doing, using the figures in the Solution folder for reference. Run and debug your script as you go, and feel free to check your code against the solution (lab4.m in the Solution folder) at any point. 

In "HW 7 — Load Lines," you'll find two scripts outside of the Solution folder — load_lines.m and load_line_plot_tutorial.m. As for "Lab 4 — Diodes and Transistors," you will open the script load_line_plot_tutorial.m, go through the code, and find the areas in which you have to fill in the code. However, since this script is a function, to debug it you'll use load_lines.m. In other words, when you want to check your code, you should run load_lines.m, which calls load_line_plot_tutorial.m. The solution file is load_line_plot.m in the Solution folder.

### Advanced Tutorials
In Advanced Tutorials, CoolExtras.mlx introduces some more advanced MATLAB functionalities, including anonymous functions, symbolic variables, and the eval command. Try this tutorial if you want to add more skills to your MATLAB toolbox!
